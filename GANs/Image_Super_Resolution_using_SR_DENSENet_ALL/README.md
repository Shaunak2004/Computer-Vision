This file contains the code about the implementation of the paper "Image Super-Resolution Using Dense Skip Connections".
The code here represents a part of the big model pressented in the paper which contains 8 Dense Layers, but i have
implemented only 5 Dense Layers, which also gave satisfactory result. The dataset used for training was "Urban-100"
and the patches were collected as guided in the paper. Testing was done using the same "Urban-100" and another dataset.

The metrics for calculation was PSNR and this model after training gave about nearly 21 PSNR. And i hope this could be
increased by adding more dense layers.
